# Watchify To-Do list

This is a comprehensive list of all of everything I would
like to have done with watchify-server before taking a break
then moving on to the next project (front-end watchify)

- [ ] Finish series handler
- [ ] Genres
- [ ] Video thumbnails
- [ ] Users w/ authentication
- [ ] Server front-end (html) for monitoring, altering storage
- [ ] Ensure that endpoints follow REST standard
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation/implementation
- [ ] Necessary and in-depth comments
- [ ] Logging to file for debugging and cleaner console
